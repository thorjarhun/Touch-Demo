# Touch-Demo
A very simple demo of sharing mouse/touch coordinates on a browser window using socket.io. Credits to getify for the idea. I can't find the project at the moment but if/when I do, I'll be sure to update with a link.

### TODO
- Implement something to normalize screen boundaries between users with various document dimensions. Based on some fixed aspect ratio, simply scaling would probably be better than truncation.
- Improve fading trail effect. A fancy snake-like mouse tail might be cool.
